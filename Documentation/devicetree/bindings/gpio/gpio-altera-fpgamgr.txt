Altera FPGA Manager GPIO controller bindings

Required controller properties:
- #address-cells : Should be 1
- #size-cells : Should be 0
- compatible:
  - "altr,fpgamgr-gpio"
- reg: Physical base address and length of the controller's registers.

The FPGA Manager has two 32-bit ports, one for input and one for output.

Port properties:
- compatible:
  - "altr,fpgamgr-gpio-output"
  - "altr,fpgamgr-gpio-input"
- #gpio-cells : Should be 2
  - The first cell is the gpio offset number.
  - The second cell is reserved and is currently unused.
- gpio-controller : Marks the device node as a GPIO controller.
- reg : Port number, 0 for output, 1 for input.

Example:

gpio3: gpio@ff706010 {
  #address-cells = <1>;
  #size-cells = <0>;
  compatible = "altr,fpgamgr-gpio";
  reg = <0xff706010 0x8>;

  portd: gpio-controller@0 {
    compatible = "altr,fpgamgr-gpio-output";
    gpio-controller;
    #gpio-cells = <2>;
    reg = <0>;
  };

  porte: gpio-controller@1 {
    compatible = "altr,fpgamgr-gpio-input";
    gpio-controller;
    #gpio-cells = <2>;
    reg = <1>;
  };
};
